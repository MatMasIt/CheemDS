# CheemsDs

!["Bonk"](cheems.png)

Simple "Cheems Bonk Game" with a counter and sound effects, as it should be.

Inspired by the ["Hit Cheems"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.logic.hitcheems) app for Android.

Made in an afternoon because it did not exist yet, now you can bonk Cheems on the DS.

# Building

After setting up devKitPro with ds libraries, just run `make`.
